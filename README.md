### Missing data

options:

- droping duplicates
- dropping empty values
- imputation

## stratified sampling

This is called stratified sampling: the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups called strata,
and the right number of instances is sampled from each stratum to guarantee that the
test set is representative of the overall population. If they used purely random sam‚Äê
pling, there would be about 12% chance of sampling a skewed test set with either less
than 49% female or more than 54% female. Either way, the survey results would be
significantly biased
